# NostalgiaForSimplicity 

The objective of this project is to create a simple and flexible bot that can be adapted to multiple strategies. 

Currently the bot has these features:

- Load signals from "signals" directory.
- Live reloading of signals when files are modified (no need to restart freqtrade).
- Priority based signals.

The bot is not finished and any help is appreciated in the form of comments or PRs.
