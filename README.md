# NostalgiaForSimplicity 

The objective of this project is to create a simple and flexible bot that can be adapted to multiple strategies. 

Currently the bot has these features:

- Load signals from "signals" directory.
- Live reloading of signals when files are modified (no need to restart freqtrade).
- Priority based signals.


## Disclaimer 

I am not responsible for any monetary losses, damages, or inaccuracies arising from the use of the bot. The bot is provided "as is," without any guarantees or warranties, express or implied. It is important to note that the bot is not finalized and may contain errors or incomplete features. It is strongly recommended to perform thorough backtests and dry-runs to evaluate its functionality before applying it in any context. Use it at your own risk and verify any outcomes independently.
