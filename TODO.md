# TODO list

- Explore and create more signals, currently imported from NFIX5.
- Classify signals based on their speed (scalping or swing) and add exit lines for each type.
- Improve global protections and adapt for different speeds.
- Exit signal should have a time exit predefined (like minimal_roi but specific for signal).
- Indicator generation should be done from directory signals, and populate_indicators should call signals with priority
